# Portfolio Week 2 Challenge Assignment 

In this challenge I created a Portfolio using only CSS & HTML. As a developer I wanted to create an initial webpage to begin showcasing the projects & work that i've created. Personally, It was challenging for doing vanilla CSS but a good learning experience. One thing I struggled with is with the flexboxes & attempting to make the page mobile responsive. I hope to be able to have more opportunities to work with CSS.
